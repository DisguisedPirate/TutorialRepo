Hi! Welcome to the GitHub tutorial.

By following these instructions, I'm going to run you through the basic processes for GitHub to function
with Visual Studio as I've been able to understand them after a few sleepless nights!

Links used throughout the tutorial: 
- https://visualstudio.github.com/ (GitHub extension for Visual Studio)
- https://github.com/DisguisedPirate/TutorialRepo (Tutorial Repository)

**The Team Explorer**

Navigate to View > Team Explorer. This will open up a menu to the right of your screen, where the solution explorer primarily is.
This is the Team Explorer. It is our connection to the main repository for all of our projects, and your way of switching between 
those projects while using Visual Studio. With the GitHub extension installed, you should see two options on this screen: GitHub and Azure.
